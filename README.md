# Python_Calculator_learning
This is a project I created on 6 October 2024 while learning python for the first time, there is nothing new in it just publishing this code to make this remembered as my first python project, this code works simply on if statements and only does the functions of a calculator for two numbers at a time, the results are rounded of to two decimal points 
thanks for readin!
